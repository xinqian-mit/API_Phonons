This is a API that interfaces ase, lammps, phonopy, thirdorder.py and quippy for molecular simulation.
Currently uses python3.
The phonopy version is 2.7.1

bandplot is used to export band.yaml files to text, new version of phonopy-bandplot doesn't have this
function anymore, but using bandplot requires phonopy installed.
